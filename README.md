  - [Ubuntu](doc/readme/Ubuntu.md)

## Environment

Set the following environment variables to control and configure the behaviour of the application:

| Name                  |    Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | :-----------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOG_IGNORED_LEXEMES` |    `true`     | When `true`, logs all of the ignored lexemes found with Flex at DEBUGGING level. To remove those logs from the console output set it to `false`.                      |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL`       | `INFORMATION` | The minimum level to log in the console output. From lower to higher, the available levels are: `ALL`, `DEBUGGING`, `INFORMATION`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`. |

# Running the Python Program

To run the generated Python programs, you will need **Python 3** and several essential libraries installed on your system.

---

## 1. Install Python 3

You must have **Python version 3.8 or newer**.

### On Windows

* Download the latest installer from the official Python website:
  ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Run the installer.
  **Important**: On the first screen, check the box at the bottom that says **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking "Install Now".
  This allows you to run Python from any command prompt.

### On macOS

* The recommended method is to use **Homebrew**.
  If you have Homebrew installed, open the Terminal and run:

  ```bash
  brew install python3
  ```

* Alternatively, you can download the official macOS installer from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).

### On Linux

* For Debian, Ubuntu, or other derivatives, use the `apt` package manager:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3
  ```

---

## 2. Install Required Libraries

With Python installed, install the necessary libraries (`pygame` and `numpy`) using `pip`.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

**Note**: On some macOS and Linux systems, you may need to use `pip3` instead:

```bash
pip3 install pygame numpy
```

---

## 3. Run the Program

Once everything is installed, you can run the simulation:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (e.g., `your_program_name.py`).
3. Run the script with:

   ```bash
   python3 your_program_name.py
   ```

   *(On Windows, you may need to use **`python`** instead of **`python3`**.)*

## Running and Compiling a Program

To compile and run a program and redirect the Python output to a file, you can use the `start.sh` script located in the `/scripts/ubuntu` directory, as follows:

```bash
./start.sh "path/to/source/file" "path/to/output"
```
- `"path/to/source/file"`: path to the input source file.
- `"path/to/output.py"`: path where the Python output should be written.
